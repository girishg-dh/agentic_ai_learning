## Week 3: RAG & Memory

**Directory:** `week_03_rag_memory/src`

This module focuses on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and memory-augmented AI systems. Sample tasks and explorations include:

- Implementing RAG pipelines
- Experimenting with vector databases and knowledge retrieval
- Integrating memory into agentic workflows

> Explore the `src` directory for Python scripts and utility modules related to RAG and memory.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/girishg-dh/agentic_ai_learning.git
cd agentic_ai_learning
```

---

## Installation

> Requirements and environment setup may vary by week/module.

1. Install Python 3.8+ and `pip`.
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. Install dependencies (if a `requirements.txt` is provided in a week):
    ```bash
    pip install -r week_03_rag_memory/requirements.txt
    ```

---

## Usage

Navigate to the desired week and run code examples:

```bash
cd week_03_rag_memory/src
python <script_name>.py
```

*Replace `<script_name>.py` with the script you want to run.*
